# Dr. Goncalo Lopez will describe the Python API he wrote for the Foraging Working Group

The script [pyclub_demo.py](code/scripts/pyclub_demo.py) illustrates the use of this API. All functions of the API are located at [apy.py](code/src/aeon/proprocess/apy.py). Please refer to [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for the dependencies required to run this code.
